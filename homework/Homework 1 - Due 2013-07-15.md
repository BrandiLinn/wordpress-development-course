# Homework and Reading Due July 15, 2013

This document outlines the homework and readings that are assigned on July 8, 2013 that are due on July 15, 2013 at 6 PM.

## Homework

### Setup a publicly accessible WordPress site

In order to get WordPress usage credits, you must have a publicly accessible WordPress site that you can use. For homework this week, setup that site. You can create a WordPress site with your own hosting or you can [sign up for a site](http://signup.wordpress.com/signup/) at WordPress.com. 

Once your site is setup, you can starting working on your WordPress usage credits. I also recommend starting to experiment with WordPress features in order to begin learning how to use WordPress.

Note that if you prefer to keep your site private, that is ok. You must invite me to the site so that I can see it to verify your work.

### Setup a local develop site

In addition to setting up a publicly accessible WordPress site, you need to setup a local WordPress development site. Having a local development site makes WordPress development significantly easier and is the recommended way to develop for WordPress. I recommend using an *AMP system (e.g., [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html), [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html)) or Vagrant (e.g., [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://github.com/10up/varying-vagrant-vagrants)). 

For more information on installing WordPress, please consult the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress).

### Setup a Github or Bitbucket account

Later in the course, you will be required to submit coding homework via a version control system (VCS) export. I highly recommend storing your work in a central location such as Github or Bitbucket. This week, you should setup and begin familiarizing yourself with one of these services in anticipation of future assignments. Additionally, if using version control is unfamiliar to you, I recommend getting started by working through Code School's [interactive git training](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git). If you prefer to work with SVN, that it ok. I recommend git as it is what I will be using throughout the course.

### Plugin ideas

The final project in the course requires you to build a full fledged WordPress plugin. As you work through setting up a few WordPress sites, you should begin to think about what sort of plugin you want to build. For this week, you should think of 5 plugin ideas. You will not be required to build one of these 5 plugins; rather, this assignment is intended to get you thinking about the project and what you might want to build.

### What to turn in

By July 15, 2013 at 6 PM, you must send me an email (see syllabus for email address) with all of the following: 

* Link to your publicly accessible site
* Link to your Github or Bitbucket account
* 5 plugin ideas.
