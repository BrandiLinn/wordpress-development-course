# Introduction to WordPress

## WordPress is Born

* B2/cafelog weblog is launched in June 2001 by Michael Valdrighi
	* Competing systems at the time were MovableType, Blogger, LiveJournal, and later Textpattern
	* Estimated install base of 2000 blogs before being forked
	* Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little were users of B2
	* Matt was interested in converting his b2 site to using XHTML1.1 as influenced by Jeffrey Zeldman's work.
	* In ["Best Blogging Software"](http://ma.tt/2002/10/best-blogging-software/), a post on October 14, 2002 by Matt Mullenweg:
		> If Michel stopped developing b2 tomorrow, I would still use it because it just does everything I want it to do, plus I have a pretty good familiarity with the code, which helps a lot.
	* Matt couldn't contribute his work back to b2 without Michael
	* In ["The Blogging Software Dilemma"](http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/), a post on January 24, 2003 by Matt Mullenweg:
		> ...the main developer has disappeared, and I can only hope that he’s okay.

		> Well, it would be nice to have the flexibility of MovableType, the parsing of TextPattern, the hackability of b2, and the ease of setup of Blogger. Someday, right?

		* Textpattern's license was not "politically [agreeable]" to Matt
		* b2/cafelog was GPL which allowed Matt to fork
	* Mike Little was the first commentor:
		> Matt, If you’re serious about forking b2 I would be interested in contributing. I’m sure there are one or two others in the community who would be too. Perhaps a post to the B2 forum, suggesting a fork would be a good starting point.
* May 27, 2003: WordPress 0.7 is released
	* Standards compliance improvements
	* Add a links section (which only recently was removed)
	* Improved install process
	* Changed admin panel
	* Michael stated that WordPress was the "official" branch of b2/cafeblog
	* b2++, a multi-user "fork" of b2/cafeblog, was intended to be merged into WordPress and it's developer, Donncha O Caoimh, became the 3rd WordPress developer
	* Important to note that earlier contributors were developer-bloggers or developers
* b2/cafelog's Legacy
	* Michael was learning PHP when building it
	* Very procedural code
	* By professional standards, fairly bad code
	* Barrier to entry was *really low*, which encouraged others to contribute
